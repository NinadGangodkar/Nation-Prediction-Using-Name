# The project demonstrates Nationality Prediction Using Name implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. The project involves preprocessing textual data, building a classification model, and saving it for future sentiment predictions on new, unseen names. The project utilizes a logistic regression model with the 'count-vectors' method for classifying names into different countries. Key steps include data preprocessing, text cleaning, and feature extraction through the Count Vectorizer. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using cross-validation to measure its accuracy.
